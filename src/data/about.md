# 👩🏽‍💻 hello!

My name is **Breanna Nery**, a Filipina from Long Beach, CA.
I currently work remotely 🏡 as a **Software Engineer** for **Autodesk**. I primarily work on fullstack web development using **React** and **Ruby on Rails**.

This color generator was inspired by my lifelong appreciation of colors and my childhood hobby of collecting paint swatches.
I hope you'll find a color you appreciate 💕
