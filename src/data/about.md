# <span role='img' aria-label='woman on computer'>👩🏽‍💻</span> hello!

My name is **Breanna Nery**, a Filipina from Long Beach, CA.
I currently work remotely <span role='img' aria-label='home'>🏡</span> as a **Software Engineer** for **Autodesk**. I primarily work on fullstack web development using **React** and **Ruby on Rails**.

This color generator was inspired by my lifelong appreciation of colors and my childhood hobby of collecting paint swatches.
I hope you'll find a color you appreciate <span role='img' aria-label='heart'>💕</span>

<span role='img' aria-label='sparkle'>✨</span> Colors provided by the [color-names](https://github.com/meodai/color-names) dictionary.
